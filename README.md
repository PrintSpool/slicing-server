## Slicing Server

A version manager and job queue for your 3D printer slicing engines.

Install multiple Slic3r, Prusa Slicer, and Super Slicer versions from the command line and use them from a web page.

**Note: Work in Progress / Under Development**

Installing slicing engines should work but the web server still has some connectivity bugs in it's WebTransport implementation that are preventing it from working reliably.
